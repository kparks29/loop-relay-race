#JS Loops Relay Race (WDI Outcomes Activity)

There are six simple JS problems in [exercise.js](https://github.com/learned-at-ga/loops-relay-race/blob/master/js/exercise.js) -- they're split out by comments. **exercise.js** is the *only* file you should modify, and you should use the prescribed loops to solve each problem (instructors and guest engineers will be checking, and watching for your problem-solving strategies!).

One student from each team of 6 should volunteer their laptop for this exercise, and clone down this repo. When the instructional team says "go!" get started.

Solve a problem, then pass the laptop to your teammate! Everyone can help, but one person at a time should drive, and each person on the team should answer one problem :) 

Note: the problems increase in difficulty!
