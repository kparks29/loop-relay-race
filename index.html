        <h3>JS Loops Relay Race</h3>
        <h1>Race to solve these quick JS exercises!</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        There are six simple JS problems in <a href="js/exercise.js">exercise.js</a> -- they're split out by comments. <a href="js/exercise.js">exercise.js</a> is the <em>only</em> file you should modify, and you should use the prescribed loops to solve each problem (instructors and guest engineers will be checking, and watching for your problem-solving strategies!).</p>
        <p>Solve a problem, then pass the laptop to your teammate! Everyone can help, but one person at a time should drive, and each person on the team should answer one problem :) </p>
        <p>Note: the problems increase in difficulty!</p>
